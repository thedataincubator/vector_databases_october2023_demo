    "Vector databases are specialized databases designed to efficiently handle data in vector form. Vectors are arrays of float values. That collection of values encode other complex data, such as text. Vector representations can improve performance across a wide range of applications, including machine learning and information retrieval. To scale these data-driven applications, vector databases support the rapid retrieval of large sets of relevant vectors. Traditional relational databases are not optimized for vector-based queries and can be extremely slow when performing those operations. Vector databases support ML and AI at scale and in production environments by making vector data more accessible. "

These vectors are fixed-length. No matter the size of the object they are encoding, the resulting vector is always the same size. Vectors are easier for machines to understand and process than those other complex data types.

Semantic vectors are important modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications because all ML algorithms require data to be numerically encoded. Semantic are numerical encoded data where distance is meaningful. If data can be encoded as a semantic vector, it can be used in ML. \n",

    "In this example, we only had a couple of examples. It is more common to have thousands or millions of examples. ML algorithms become very computationally intensive at that scale, especially algorithms like k-means clustering. Vector databases are designed to manage vectors and vectors-based operations at that scale. Vector databases will have algorithms optimized for vector computation. Since vector databases do not support general-purpose computing, they can be much faster at specific vector tasks. \n",

    "One primary reason to use vector databases is to persist the vectors for later. Right now, the vectors are only in memory. If the computer restarts, the vector information will be lost. Additionally, vector databases can cache, aka store, the embeddings so we do not need to call the OpenAI API again for the same item. This is important because every call to OpenAI API costs money. Additionally, vector databases should be faster and more reliable than an API call.  "

    "There are also limitations to vector databases. Vector databases are currently in the Gartner Hype Cycle's \"Peak of Inflated Expectations\". Vector databases provide value, but the current hype might be inflating the value. This is similar to the position that MongoDB was in several years ago. MongoDB has been proven to be useful as a document database but was over-used for a period of time. Another limitation is the specific business use case might not be clear yet. Before adopting a vector database, make sure there is a clear ROI for the project and organization. Probably the biggest limitation is that a vector database is yet another separate tool to maintain. Businesses might want vector operations but not need a separate system just to support those operations. A vector extension for existing databases, such as pgvector for Postgres, might provide enough functionality with minimal additional complexity."
